# Config and Secrets

### Steps

1. Create a configmap named myconfig with values <your-firstname>-1=lala,<your-firstname>-2=lolo

    ```bash
        kubectl create configmap <your-firstname>-myconfig --from-literal=<your-firstname>-1=lala --from-literal=<your-firstname>-2=lolo
    ```

1. Create a secret called mysecret with the values <your-firstname>-password=mypass

    ```bash
        kubectl create secret generic <your-firstname>-mysecret --from-literal=<your-firstname>-password=mypass
    ```

1. Create a new nginx pod that loads the value from configmap ```<your-firstname>-myconfig``` ->  ```<your-firstname>-1``` in an env variable called 'option'. Also load secret '<your-firstname>-mysecret' as a volume inside an nginx pod on path ```/etc/secrets```.

    ```bash
    # review the manifest and look how the configMap and secret is referenced    
    # make sure your terminal's directory is set to yaml_files folder. `cd` into  or `cd ..` as needed.

    # open `config-and-secrets.yaml` in `yaml_files` folder with vs-code or just cat.    
    cat config-and-secrets.yaml

    # Create Pod from the script file
    # If you get file not found, make sure your terminal is set to right directory.    
    kubectl apply -f config-and-secrets.yaml

    # Or you can pass full path. 
    # For example, if your terminal is at `cw` folder, then 
    # `kubectl apply -f ./labs/02_kubernetes/yaml_files/config-and-secrets.yaml`
    ```

1. Check environment variable ```option``` and ```/etc/secrets``` has expected values

    ```bash
    kubectl exec -it nginx -- env | grep option
    kubectl exec -it nginx -- ls /etc/secrets
    ```
